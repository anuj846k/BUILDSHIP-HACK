## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Sahara AI uses a hybrid architecture combining VAPI for call management and Buildship for AI processing:

1. **VAPI Integration:** Handles incoming emergency calls and provides call data
2. **Buildship Workflow:** Processes call data through serverless AI analysis
3. **Frontend Dashboard:** Displays real-time analysis and emergency response interface

### Buildship Workflow

Our serverless workflow includes:
- **REST API Trigger:** Receives emergency call data
- **OpenAI Assistant:** Analyzes call severity, category, and emotions
- **Location Extraction:** Identifies emergency location from call transcripts
- **Structured Response:** Returns formatted analysis for dashboard display
